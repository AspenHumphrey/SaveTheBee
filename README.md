## Technologies Used:
React, React Native, ReactVR, Docker, GraphQL, NodeJS, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL

## Installations:
### React: https://reactjs.org/docs/installation.html
Create React App is the best way to start building a new React single page application. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine. 

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app

cd my-app
npm start
```
If you have version 5.2.0+ of npm use:

```
npx create-react-app my-app

cd my-app
npm start
```

### ReactVR: https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/
React VR lets you build VR apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich VR world and UI from declarative components.

Getting started:
```
We can use the React VR command line interface tool to generate a new project called “WelcomeToVR.” The tool creates a new folder containing the skeleton for a React VR project and fetches all the necessary external dependencies.

If you are still running npm in your terminal window, press CTRL+C to stop it.

Navigate to a directory where you want to put your new project.

Install the React VR CLI tool. Enter:

 npm install -g react-vr-cli
Use the React VR CLI tool to create a new application under a WelcomeToVR folder and install the required dependencies. Enter:

 react-vr init WelcomeToVR
Change directory to your new WelcomeToVR project directory.

 cd WelcomeToVR
Use the start command to initialize your local development server. Enter:

 npm start
Open your browser to http://localhost:8081/vr/index.html. 
```
### NodeJS:
1. Run npm install node.js in the terminal to be able to run node

### NodeMon:
2. Run npm install -g nodemon in the terminal to install and access nodemon

### NPM:
1. Run npm init —y in the terminal to initial npm so further commands may be used
2. Run npm install —save -dev to install the node modules both globally and save it to the package.json in one step.

### BodyParser:
1. Run npm install body-parser 

### pg-hstore:
```
npm install pg-hstore
```

### PG - Node/Postgres
```
npm install pg
```
