## Technologies Used:
React, React Native, ReactVR, Docker, GraphQL, NodeJS, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL

## Installations:
### React: https://reactjs.org/docs/installation.html
Create React App is the best way to start building a new React single page application. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine. 

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app

cd my-app
npm start
```
If you have version 5.2.0+ of npm use:

```
npx create-react-app my-app

cd my-app
npm start
```

### ReactVR: https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/
React VR lets you build VR apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich VR world and UI from declarative components.

Getting started:
```
We can use the React VR command line interface tool to generate a new project called “WelcomeToVR.” The tool creates a new folder containing the skeleton for a React VR project and fetches all the necessary external dependencies.

If you are still running npm in your terminal window, press CTRL+C to stop it.

Navigate to a directory where you want to put your new project.

Install the React VR CLI tool. Enter:

 npm install -g react-vr-cli
Use the React VR CLI tool to create a new application under a WelcomeToVR folder and install the required dependencies. Enter:

 react-vr init WelcomeToVR
Change directory to your new WelcomeToVR project directory.

 cd WelcomeToVR
Use the start command to initialize your local development server. Enter:

 npm start
Open your browser to http://localhost:8081/vr/index.html. 
```
### NodeJS:
1. Run npm install node.js in the terminal to be able to run node

### NodeMon:
2. Run npm install -g nodemon in the terminal to install and access nodemon

### NPM:
1. Run npm init —y in the terminal to initial npm so further commands may be used
2. Run npm install —save -dev to install the node modules both globally and save it to the package.json in one step.

### BodyParser:
1. Run npm install body-parser 

### pg-hstore:
1. npm install pg-hstore

### PG - Node/Postgres
1. npm install pg

### GraphQL: http://graphql.org/code/#javascript
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

The reference implementation of the GraphQL specification, designed for running GraphQL in a Node.js environment.
1. npm install graphql

### Express GraphQL: http://graphql.org/code/#javascript
The reference implementation of a GraphQL API server over an Express webserver. You can use this to run GraphQL in conjunction with a regular Express webserver, or as a standalone GraphQL server.
1. npm install express express-graphql graphql
